Yes, I do realize some of this is horribly ugly coding. Any
ideas/suggestions would be appreciated by emailing me or by stopping
by http://github.com/KittyKatt/screenFetch . You could also drop in on
my IRC network, SilverIRC, at
irc://kittykatt.silverirc.com:6667/screenFetch to put forth
suggestions/ideas. Thank you.
